### **How to Approach Your Text-Based Adventure Game Project**
Breaking the project into smaller, manageable chunks is essential. Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step plan** for a 2-week timeline with daily tasks:

---

### **Day 1: Define the Gameâ€™s Scope**
1. **What the Game Will Do**:
   - Basic movement between rooms.
   - Descriptions of rooms and directions.
   - Player actions like `go`, `look`, and `take`.

2. **What It Wonâ€™t Do** (Optional Features):
   - No need for advanced AI or complex inventories yet.

3. **Create a Rough Plan**:
   - List the key components: Rooms, Player, Items, Game Engine.

---

### **Day 2-3: Build the Core Classes**
1. **Create a `Room` Class**:
   - Attributes: `name`, `description`, `connections` (e.g., `{'north': room2}`).
   - Methods: `connect_room()`, `get_description()`.

   ```python
   class Room:
       def __init__(self, name, description):
           self.name = name
           self.description = description
           self.connections = {}

       def connect_room(self, direction, room):
           self.connections[direction] = room

       def get_description(self):
           return f"{self.name}\n{self.description}"
   ```

2. **Create a `Player` Class**:
   - Attributes: `current_room`, `inventory`.
   - Methods: `move(direction)`, `look()`.

   ```python
   class Player:
       def __init__(self, starting_room):
           self.current_room = starting_room
           self.inventory = []

       def move(self, direction):
           if direction in self.current_room.connections:
               self.current_room = self.current_room.connections[direction]
               return f"You moved {direction}."
           else:
               return "You can't go that way."
   ```

---

### **Day 4-5: Create the Game World**
1. **Set Up Rooms**:
   - Create instances of the `Room` class and connect them.

   ```python
   # Example rooms
   cave = Room("Mysterious Cave", "You find yourself in a dimly lit cave...")
   library = Room("Ancient Library", "This room is filled with old, dusty bookshelves...")
   
   # Connect rooms
   cave.connect_room("north", library)
   library.connect_room("south", cave)
   ```

2. **Set Up the Player**:
   - Place the player in the starting room.
   ```python
   player = Player(cave)
   ```

---

### **Day 6-7: Implement Player Actions**
1. **Handle Commands**:
   - Create a function to process input like `go north`, `look`, or `take`.

   ```python
   def process_command(player, command):
       parts = command.split()
       action = parts[0]
       
       if action == "go":
           if len(parts) > 1:
               direction = parts[1]
               return player.move(direction)
           else:
               return "Go where?"
       elif action == "look":
           return player.current_room.get_description()
       else:
           return "Unknown command."
   ```

2. **Test Basic Commands**:
   - Run a loop to test movement and descriptions.
   ```python
   while True:
       command = input("> ")
       print(process_command(player, command))
   ```

---

### **Day 8-9: Add Items**
1. **Create an `Item` Class**:
   - Attributes: `name`, `description`.
   - Methods: `__str__()`.

   ```python
   class Item:
       def __init__(self, name, description):
           self.name = name
           self.description = description

       def __str__(self):
           return f"{self.name}: {self.description}"
   ```

2. **Place Items in Rooms**:
   - Add an `items` attribute to `Room`.
   - Implement `take` and `drop` actions.

   ```python
   class Room:
       def __init__(self, name, description):
           self.name = name
           self.description = description
           self.connections = {}
           self.items = []

       def add_item(self, item):
           self.items.append(item)
   ```

   ```python
   def process_command(player, command):
       parts = command.split()
       action = parts[0]
       
       if action == "take":
           item_name = " ".join(parts[1:])
           for item in player.current_room.items:
               if item.name.lower() == item_name.lower():
                   player.inventory.append(item)
                   player.current_room.items.remove(item)
                   return f"You picked up {item.name}."
           return "Item not found."
       elif action == "inventory":
           return "You are carrying: " + ", ".join(str(item) for item in player.inventory)
   ```

---

### **Day 10-12: Add Challenges or Puzzles**
1. **Implement Conditional Room Access**:
   - For example, require a key to open a door.

   ```python
   class Room:
       def __init__(self, name, description, locked=False, key=None):
           self.name = name
           self.description = description
           self.connections = {}
           self.locked = locked
           self.key = key

       def unlock(self, item):
           if self.key and item.name == self.key:
               self.locked = False
               return "The room is now unlocked!"
           return "You can't unlock this room."
   ```

2. **Test Puzzles**:
   - Create a locked room and a key to solve it.

---

### **Day 13: Add Polish**
1. **Enhance Descriptions**:
   - Add dynamic descriptions based on player actions.
2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Add messages for invalid commands or edge cases.

---

### **Day 14: Final Testing and Debugging**
1. **Play Through**:
   - Ensure all commands and transitions work as expected.
2. **Get Feedback**:
   - Ask peers or mentors to playtest your game.

### **Key Tips**
1. **Start Simple**: Focus on core mechanics before adding complexity.
2. **Test Daily**: Playtest your game frequently to ensure it works.
3. **Iterate**: Improve features after basic functionality is complete.
4. **Ask for Help**: Donâ€™t hesitate to ask mentors or peers for advice.

This plan ensures you build the game step by step, without feeling overwhelmed! ðŸ˜Š
